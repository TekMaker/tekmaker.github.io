#TekMaker# ##(previously CompElecBox) is a channel designed to help people of all ages and abilities to learn about and build projects for Computers and Electronics.##


Having witnessed many poor quality and badly informed channels I decided I could do better. I  previously worked in Electronics for 25+ years including design work and been involved in computer servicing, networking and programming for over 20 years. I hope to produce projects and videos and instructions that are simple enough for any age or ability. That said some projects are main voltage powered and should be built with extreme caution and supervision. You do this at your own risk!


Rather than just making projects to use once and then put on the shelf I will endeavour to make projects that will connect or work together and for useful things if you want to set up an electronics or single board computer lab at home.
